<h4>On the Web</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8 - Python's style guide</a>
    <p>Having just spent a large chunk of time playing in Ruby, coming across this style guide was a little jarring in its freedom. I spent all week asking a python-programming friend "What's the convention for [thing]" and him constantly telling me he's not sure there is one.</p></li>
  <li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/">On Apple's ban on templated apps</a></li>
</ul>

    <p>Finished this book on TDD this week. It was definitely an interesting read and I think 100% worth it for anyone wanting to get a better idea of TDD. I don't agree with everything in the book, but I think it's always important to get differing opinions on techniques. Maybe my opinion will change, but at the very least I'll be more informed on why I believe what I believe.</p></li>

    <p>Still making my way through this novel, which is fascinating and delightful. I highly recommend it, even if it is a slower read for me. </p></li>
