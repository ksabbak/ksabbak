<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>I spent the past day and a half diving in to Jekyll to set up this blog, and now I'm going to talk about it:</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I followed <a href="https://css-tricks.com/building-a-jekyll-site-part-1-of-3/">css-tricks' tutorial</a> to set up the blog itself. I only followed part one so far, and when I set up comments, I will probably skip to part three since part two is about setting up a CMS, and I'm the only one writing this blog so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

<p>To set up the tagging system, <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll"/>Charlie Park's tutorial</a> was a lifesaver.</p>

<p>For now, watch this space for further development! Mostly new blog posts, and hopefully soon a comments system.</p>
