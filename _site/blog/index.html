<p>I think I'm a kinetic learner. That's why I <a href="http://ksabbak.com/2018/02/16/My-Favorite-Refactor-Tool.html">print out my code</a> when I refactor. That's also why if I want to get anything out of printed code examples (excepting the smallest/shortest of examples), I have to type them up myself. I've been reading <i>Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices</i> (PPP) lately, and Robert Martin really, really likes his code examples that span <em>pages</em>. Maybe there are people out there who can get something out of just reading those examples, but for me, it's way too much to keep in my head at once, especially without language highlighting, but also in general.</p>

<p>I am new to the tech world — kinda — but I'm going to be writing this post as if it were something that happened to me years ago instead of like, last week to give me some distance so that I can write about this cleanly, and maybe get some perspective in the process.</p>

<p>I'm a woman in tech and I have a problem with women in tech. Not on the conscious level, of course.

<p>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the S in SOLID programming and it is exactly what it says on the tin. Every class should have one responsibility.</p>

<p>Clojure is weird. I like it a lot, but it’s weird. Or, at least it <em>looks</em> weird, like <em>really</em> weird. I come from a background that's not nearly as LISP-y as Clojure. So the syntax really threw me. And it will continue to throw me. But there are a few things that at least help me read what I'm writing and for that, I will be forever grateful.</p>

<p>Let's talk about threading macros!</p>

<p>On the surface “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) seems pretty self-explanatory. It’s the concept in writing code that one should … never repeat oneself. Simple! Well, mostly. There’s actually two parts to this, and the second one is the hidden gotcha that took me quite a while to grasp, and I’m still working on actually applying that knowledge to what I write.</p>
