<p>I was recently able to work on a project with a fellow apprentice. It was an amazing opportunity and I had a blast working on it. But it was also two weeks and change of non-stop pairing. I've paired before. I've even paired that long before, but not with one individual. And it had been a year or so since I had to put my pairing skills, learned through the late and great Dev Bootcamp (DBC) to use. It was a learning experience for sure.</p>

<p>Starting from the beginning of the SOLID principles is a great way to lure yourself into a false sense of confidence. After all, S stands for <a href="http://ksabbak.com/2018/04/13/Single-Responsibility-Principle-and-Some-Fencing.html">Single Responsibility Principle</a> and while it can be a challenge to follow, it is at least very easy to understand. And then you get to O with the "Open/Closed Principle" you're basically all <br> ????? (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  ????</p>


<p>Same, friends. Let's unpack this much less straightforwardly named principle.</p>

<p>I just spent a good chunk of my time in the world of Clojure learning functional programming. It was hard (and fun) and I expected it to be hard (and hoped it would be fun). Now I'm working on learning Java and back in the world of object oriented programming and while I expected Java to be hard and not fun (so far I'm right), what I didn't expect is... what's OOP?</p>

<p>I think I'm a kinetic learner. That's why I <a href="http://ksabbak.com/2018/02/16/My-Favorite-Refactor-Tool.html">print out my code</a> when I refactor. That's also why if I want to get anything out of printed code examples (excepting the smallest/shortest of examples), I have to type them up myself. I've been reading <i>Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices</i> (PPP) lately, and Robert Martin really, really likes his code examples that span <em>pages</em>. Maybe there are people out there who can get something out of just reading those examples, but for me, it's way too much to keep in my head at once, especially without language highlighting, but also in general.</p>
