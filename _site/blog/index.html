<p>I am new to the tech world — kinda — but I’m going to be writing this post as if it were something that happened to me years ago instead of like, last week to give me some distance so that I can write about this cleanly, and maybe get some perspective in the process.</p>

<p>I’m a woman in tech and I have a problem with women in tech. Not on the conscious level, of course.

<p>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the S in SOLID programming and it is exactly what it says on the tin. Every class should have one responsibility.</p>

<p>Clojure is weird. I like it a lot, but it’s weird. Or, at least it <em>looks</em> weird, like <em>really</em> weird. I come from a background that's not nearly as LISP-y as Clojure. So the syntax really threw me. And it will continue to throw me. But there are a few things that at least help me read what I'm writing and for that, I will be forever grateful.</p>

<p>Let's talk about threading macros!</p>

<p>On the surface “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) seems pretty self-explanatory. It’s the concept in writing code that one should … never repeat oneself. Simple! Well, mostly. There’s actually two parts to this, and the second one is the hidden gotcha that took me quite a while to grasp, and I’m still working on actually applying that knowledge to what I write.</p>

<p>I've been reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=020161622X&linkCode=as2&tag=ksabbak-20&linkId=4ab833b7465b8fff2459edabdede0eda">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> lately. While this book was published in 2000, the overall content is still relevant, even if some of the details are less applicable almost 20 years later (e.g. joining Usenets). Plus, as someone who is the proud owner of a small collection of computer books written before I was born, 2000 is nothing.</p>

<p>One section stood out to me though. "Text Manipulation" - the one on being the master of one (and only one) really good text editor and using it for everything. Initially I dismissed this as good advice, but advice that goes without saying these days. But then I realized I wasn't really following it.</p>
