<p>I’ve spent a good chunk of time refactoring recently. It’s taught me a lot, mostly on code structure and good design but also about myself and my working style. I’m not sure if I’d count as a kinesthetic learner, after all, I’m really bad at Sports, but my favorite refactoring tool is my printer. I’m pretty sure this also makes me a bad millennial (for owning a printer at all…).</p>

<p>I'd like to think I work better with music on, but I haven't actually tested this. After all, lyrics can be very distracting, new music tends to draw my attention. I had been working mostly with Spotify's Brain Food playlist, but lately there have been three or so songs that just... talk and it was driving me crazy. "Did you hear about the story about the Russian cosmonaut?"
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ </p>

<p>The other day I read an article (who knows which one) that just casually threw out there that listening to one song over and over again increases focus and creativity. There were no links to any research to support this, but I liked the idea so I figured I'd see how it worked for me.</p>

<p>Here's a fun fact about me: I have a BA in Linguistics. What did I think I was going to do with that? Well, probably more school, but at some point I realized that was the wrong path for me. That being said, I really appreciated what I learned as a linguistics student. </p>

<p>The very first linguistics class I took was probably LING114 taught by Prof. Glick. The thing about Prof. Glick is he was the head of SUNY Binghamton's Linguistics department, and I took a lot of his classes. He had three principles about language that given how often I took his classes, I will likely never forget. The goal here is to try to apply them to code - after all, we may be coding in constructed languages, but they're functionally very similar to natural languages in many ways.</p>

<p>So you're at a party and someone turns to you and says "You do things with code, right? What's the blockchain?" and in you're head you're all "Oh my god, I do work with code, what <em>is</em> the blockchain???" and aloud you recreate this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APcgsRdW6w">clickhole video on bitcoin</a>. Everyone nods as if they understand you, you nod as if you understand you and then you go home and fall down a rabbit hole where you end up learning a lot about cryptographic hash functions, some nonsense about the blockchain and you can finally rest assured that the next time you're at a party and get asked, you can safely tangent about cryptographic hash functions, which sounds smart and cool, ergo making you sound smart and cool and the world is right again. </p>

<p>Or you can just read this blog post. It's not about the blockchain at all.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, and I know I am (who did I steal that from? It’s awful), change is hard. There are probably studies done that make a case for why this is, but regardless of the why, change is just really hard.</p>

<p>For me, learning design principles in writing code is basically on par with changing how I believe the world works. It’s hard and uncomfortable and this is how it goes:</p>
