<p>There are so many posts out there on minimax and tic-tac-toe. So many posts and youtube videos and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. Mostly, they focus on the implementation of the algorithm, which is super important, but I found an excellent MIT lecture on the whys behind minimax and I want to share it.</p>

<p>I've slowly been making my way through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555976859/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1555976859&linkCode=as2&tag=ksabbak-20&linkId=3003d11c9a25a7161386bcd305ef6631">Geek Sublime: The Beauty of Code, the Code of Beauty</a> in my free time and one of the first thing the book tackles is how people work in the tech industry and don't know how computers work. As someone who entered tech with a bootcamp background, this rings true to me. Though we spent a good deal of time immersed in learning how to code, and managed to get some of the basics of web protocol, we certainly didn't touch on logic gates or binary. To be honest, I can't tell if Chandra believes that people who work in tech <em>need</em> to understand how computers work on a fundamental scale, but he does help demystify some of it.</p>

<p>I'm kind of lucky, due mostly to an interest in the subject and the vague idea that I might get a CS minor (I never did), I managed to take a few classes in college that set me up with some of this basic knowledge. I also held onto the notebook that was my trusty companion through these classes.</p>

<p>I’ve had a minute to spend more time in Ruby this week and I’m always floored by the wild stuff that this language lets me do. Here’s some of the fancy stuff I learned about HEREDOCs.</p>

<p>There have only been like two instances ever in my very short life in programming where I have tried writing in a code base that I haven't contributed to from the start. The first time was a sort of open-source volunteer group thing and I still don't understand a single thing that is happening in that code base, though I managed to modify an API call enough to contribute to a ticket.</p>

<p>The second one was just this week where I got to pair with someone who has been working in that code base for about a year. I'm not sure how much I contributed, but if I had to pick a project to work on right now in order to save the world or something, it'd DEFINITELY be that one.</p>

<p>My first programming class was when I was 17. It was also my teacher’s first time teaching a programming class. It was in Java and we used a library called Karel J. Robot, which felt like it was aimed at much younger kids, and I remember having a hard time matching what I was learning from the separate textbook and what I was building with Karel J. Robot. I also remember that a lot of my classmates were taking the class because they knew they’d be able to play games online for a whole class period. What I’m trying to say is that it was not the best programming class ever.</p>

<p>Whether or not I learned Java is a little unclear, but what I did learn is that programming was interesting and powerful and I loved it. I also learned a second lesson, which took much longer to surface, but that was that you don’t have to be an expert to teach something. That even just knowing enough can make a huge difference and change people’s lives.</p>
