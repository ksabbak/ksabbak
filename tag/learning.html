<p>My first programming class was when I was 17. It was also my teacher’s first time teaching a programming class. It was in Java and we used a library called Karel J. Robot, which felt like it was aimed at much younger kids, and I remember having a hard time matching what I was learning from the separate textbook and what I was building with Karel J. Robot. I also remember that a lot of my classmates were taking the class because they knew they’d be able to play games online for a whole class period. What I’m trying to say is that it was not the best programming class ever.</p>

<p>Whether or not I learned Java is a little unclear, but what I did learn is that programming was interesting and powerful and I loved it. I also learned a second lesson, which took much longer to surface, but that was that you don’t have to be an expert to teach something. That even just knowing enough can make a huge difference and change people’s lives.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, and I know I am (who did I steal that from? It’s awful), change is hard. There are probably studies done that make a case for why this is, but regardless of the why, change is just really hard.</p>

<p>For me, learning design principles in writing code is basically on par with changing how I believe the world works. It’s hard and uncomfortable and this is how it goes:</p>

<p>Today I was reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321146530&linkCode=as2&tag=ksabbak-20&linkId=4e7461290a20f901c3d5d46fe1221182"><cite>Test Driven Development: By Example</cite></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=ksabbak-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0321146530" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, by Kent Beck and following along with the python example. I had hit a few snags when copying directly from the book, but nothing I wasn't able to fix in about 30 seconds, but then I ran into a huge problem and it took me the better part of an afternoon to sort through.</p>

<p>At first I was very upset about it.</p>
